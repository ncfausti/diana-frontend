When successful, the attacker is able to change the logic of SQL statements executed against the database. The vulnerability is an input validation issue and occurs when SQL queries are insecurely constructed with user input that has not been properly sanitized. Serious risks can arise when an application trusts input supplied by an attacker that is destined for a back-end database with little or no validation."

In the simplest case, an attacker posts an â€œimageâ€ link on an online forum, and entices the victims to visit the forum (through marketing email or an interesting post). The link is actually an HTTP GET handler on the targeted application that performs some malicious operation. If the victim happens to be authenticated to the application, the browser will make the request on behalf of the victim and send the session cookies along with the request. To the targeted application, the request seems legitimate because the cookie values are valid, and therefore the application processes a request that was not intended by the victim."
